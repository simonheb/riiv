# riiv
## literature
contains related literature

## "code package"
contains some first simulation code in a package (`riiv`). in particular, the file `scripts/example simulation.R` has an illustrative example based on the approach from rosenbaum's ri+iv talk (see literature folder). running this code might require building the `riiv`-package first.
