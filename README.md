# riiv
collecting papers and writing code for a simulation of ri in an iv-context.

## literature
contains related literature

## "code package"
contains some first simulation code in a package (`riiv`). in particular, the file `scripts/example simulation.R` has an illustrative example based on the approach from rosenbaum's ri+iv talk (see literature folder). running this code might require building the `riiv`-package first.

simon tried to add some comments in the code, but most of it is probably not self-explanatory. ask me about anything that's unclear.
